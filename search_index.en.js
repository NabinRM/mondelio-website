There are four key approaches, each with their own unique business benefits. So, how do you know which is right for your organisation? Read on to find out.\nThe 4 different types of Business Analytics\n\nDescriptive Analytics\nDiagnostic Analytics\nPredictive Analytics\nPrescriptive Analytics\n\n\nWhat they mean in plain English\n\nWhat happened?\nWhy did it happen?\nWhat will happen?\nHow can we make it happen?\n\nDescriptive Analytics (what happened)\nThis approach is generally used for Financial Reporting and compares historical data sets in revenue and expenses, such as:\n\nYearly results\nMonth to month movements\n\nThis information helps management compare KPIs between different areas of the company and delivers a clear view of strengths and weaknesses in different departments.\n\nFig 1 Aradhana Pandey – Mastech Digital\n\nDiagnostic Analytics (why did it happen)\nThis is where we take a deeper look at the data to try and understand the cause of events and behaviours. It usually takes the form of:\n\nDrill-down\nData discovery\nData mining\nCorrelation techniques\n\nThis allows the organisation to understand data quickly and answer critical questions through the use of visualisations.\nPredictive Analytics (what will happen)\nHere we take current and historical data then use statistics and modelling techniques to look for patterns and determine if these patterns are likely to occur again.\nPattern matching allows an organisation to plan their resourcing to take advantage of possible future events.\nThere are different types of Predictive Analytics such as:\n\nData mining which includes the analysis of large quantities of data\nTest analysis is similar to data mining but looks at large blocks of text\n\n\nFig 2 Methods for Predictive Analytics https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401218309873#fig0010\n\nPredictive Analytics is widely used in:\n\nInsurance / Risk Management industries for determining future claims based on the existing pool of policyholders.\nMarketing Companies look at how consumers have reacted to past campaigns and economic conditions when planning future campaigns.\nStock Market traders will look at moving averages and break points based on historical data.\n\nPrescriptive Analytics (how can we make it happen)\nHere we use Predictive Analytics (the review of current and historical data patterns to determine future patterns) but take a step further by analysing the data to recommend future action, rather than just repeating favourable patterns.\n\nFig 3 Methods for Prescriptive Analytics https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401218309873#fig0010\n\nPrescriptive Analytics utilises artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning, where computer programs understand and analyse data without additional human input.\nPrescriptive Analytics can be used to:\n\nLimit risk\nIncrease efficiencies\nAttain business goals\nPrevent fraud\n\nHowever, it’s limited by the organisation asking the correct questions and knowing how to react to the answers. If the inputs going in are invalid, then the outputs will be inaccurate.\nUsed correctly, Prescriptive Analytics’ strength lies in helping the organisation make decisions based on facts and probable projections, rather than on individual intuition or instinct.\nPrescriptive Analytics is widely used in the government and financial and health care sectors, due to the high exposure of human error. Example uses could be city wide fire evacuation plans, analysing hospital patients’ chances of re-admittance or airline pricing due to natural disasters.\n\nFig 4 Category of methods https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401218309873#fig0010\n\nBased on its use of sophisticated technology and ability to tailor solutions to meet future needs, Prescriptive Analytics is growing in popularity.\nSo while Descriptive, Diagnostic and Predictive Analytics are currently the most common types of Business Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics is where the future is heading.\nGot a thing for data?\nHead to our business hub for specialised articles that explore and explain the latest in data breakthroughs and best practice.\n\nBI &amp; Data Analytics\nCase studies\nWhitepapers\n\nFurther reading : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401218309873\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/blog/how-can-business-analytics-benefit-your-organisation/","title":"How can Business Analytics benefit your organisation?"},"https://mondelio.com/blog/lesson-3-data-democratisation/":{"body":"COVID-19 has caused huge disruptions to the way we live our lives. However, everything will eventually get to some normality again. But it will be a new norm.\nData detail during COVID-19\nI’ll be posting these insights regularly with the third lesson shown below. Data is pivotal in all of the lessons presented. They are brief and personal views. Feel free to comment and contribute.  I am expecting differences of opinion. Some of the topics are somewhat controversial. Some lessons learnt are however plainly obvious.\n\nFacts:\n\nAnyone having to lead and manage an outbreak like Covid 19 is faced with an enormous challenge.\nMost governments and leaders today err on the side of limiting how much information is shared rather than being completely transparent. However, is this the right way forward?\nAustralia’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendon Murphy said \"The only numbers I have total faith in are the Australian numbers, frankly\". Sadly, this is a problem. Of course this is no different to any other business/organisation outside of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWaiting for, wading through, and deciphering copious amounts of data is hard enough. Making sense of data and acting on it is another thing.\nPerforming with time limitations and knowing there are dire consequences on viral spread, health, commerce and life as we know it, depends on getting this bit right.\nBut the question is, how much of this information (assuming it is accurate) on hand can be published? Through which channels? What if the data is not entirely accurate or complete, must it be published but with an asterix (*)? Who determines if the source of the information reliable?\n\nOpinion:\nI was watching an episode of Q&amp;A Monday 16th March 2020, an Australia open forum program that includes a panel of guests and members of the public to debate topics. This episode centred on the coronavirus and what appeared to be easy shots at the government by panel members and the public for not being transparent.\nI’m not always a fan of Government (I think they are too big and clunky to be efficient, effective, flexible and nimble) but I have enormous respect for front line public service professional who do their best representing and servicing the nation.  Governments are not perfect, ministers don’t know it all and pandemics don’t happen every day (thankfully).\nWhat data should be shared?\nPeople/organisations in power have at their disposal information that is not freely available to everyone. What gets shared is at the discretion of those in possession of the information. Some might choose to retain data for commercial reasons, yet others elect to abstain from sharing for reasons that relate primarily to control, security, health or even safety. Yet transparency of information becomes vital because the pandemic places pressure on every facet of society. Not only on our health system and health professionals who risk their own safety for the greater good of humankind, but also the extensive impact on our very way of life.\nThe effect on our economy, resources, employment, social order, human psychology, finances, trade, lifestyle etc. is so enormous, the availability of and ability to share good, accurate data becomes paramount.\nThe flow on effect\nDelivering one message without understanding the impact this message has on other facets of society is risky. Hypothetically, what would be the flow on effect, if government was to say that we only have enough Covid-19 diagnostic test kits for 5% of the population, yet at the same time announce that half the Australia population are at risk of being infected with the disease? Will this not imply a lack of planning? Is the Australian government in control? Will this instil public fear? Is this an outcome we all want? Conversely, what is the impact of not being transparent?\nI’m a believer in complete transparency and data democracy.\nAs succinctly explained in The Age /Sydney Morning Herald on April 2, 20202  “Conspiracy theories are born out of the murky feeling that not all is being revealed to us, that the truth is still in shadow, and someone else is pulling the strings.” In other words, if you are not completely transparent, people will form their own and different opinions (right or wrong) given the lack of information. Sharing what you have, but being transparent about what data you don’t have is just as important. It buys time and avoids reactions likely to resemble panic and anxiety, promoting conspiracy theories and rumours.\nWhilst I recognise that In the case of Covid-19, the delivery of information needs to be “managed”, it must only be managed from the perspective of what is accurate, what is being verified and what is to date unknown.\nOpen sharing\nThere are always going to be polarising views when it comes to information sharing – whatever that information might be. However, when it comes to transparency it must only be open, frank, complete (warts and all) exposure. When it comes to a pandemic, everything available and qualified as accurate must be shared with the community. The conventional wisdom of giving leaders everything and assuming they are doing all of the right things is fraught with danger. Giving many people information to help fix problems is better than giving the responsibility to few people. The lesson here is share it all.\nThe challenge to consider is, once data is made public, what is the forum for sharing this information? Is it social media? I think not.\nNot a social solution\nPublic forums (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) have time and again proven to lack the rigour and the control necessary for people to access true and accurate data from which to openly debate something as important as a pandemic. The key point is once we have agreed a forum, how do we gather input and contributions from the collective and who takes the ideas and executes them to actions to benefit our people and society? Get all the data, form your own opinion.\nBlog Series:\n\nLesson 1 - Response Rates\nLesson 2 - Data Quality\nLesson 3 - Data Democratisation\nLesson 4 - Human Response\nLesson 5 - Contact Tracing\n\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/blog/lesson-3-data-democratisation/","title":"Lesson 3 – Data Democratisation"},"https://mondelio.com/blog/lesson-4-the-panic-and-human-response-the-toilet-paper-effect/":{"body":"COVID-19 has caused huge disruptions to the way we live our lives.

Data is pivotal in all of the lessons presented. They are brief and personal views. Feel free to comment and contribute.  I am expecting differences of opinion. Some of the topics are somewhat controversial. Some lessons learnt are however plainly obvious.\n\nFacts:\n\nPanic buying was the first initial human response to the pandemic. Our fight and flight mechanisms kicked into overdrive. Like a horror movie, shoppers acquired copious amounts of product, filling their trolleys indiscriminately without due respect for others. Neither did people recognise their behaviour and subsequent implications.\nOther than what we see during a war, this was humanity at its absolute worst.\nIt was counterintuitive. Unlike the events in China where everyone was in lockdown almost immediately, in western countries (Australia included) the initial lockdown was a suggestion.\nThis sent panic into overdrive. Rather than stay away from other people, there was a mad rush to supermarkets and hardware stores. This saw a large concentration of people in a single locale risking contraction and spread. People risked passing on and/or contracting Covid-19 without considering the implications of their actions.\n\nWhy did we panic?\n\nResponse to other people panic buying\nControl – refer Waleed Aly\nSecure food and consumables for the immediate future\nManage anxiety\nBiology- “…the amygdala, the emotional centre of the brain, wants us to get out of harm’s way immediately—and it doesn’t care how we avoid the lion.”\n\nWhy Toilet Paper?\n\nIn many respects, this behaviour was totally unhealthy. After all, none of the main Covid-19’s symptoms (fever, dry cough, and tiredness) had anyone ‘running’ to the bathroom\nIt defies belief that one of the first things to be devoured off the supermarket shelves was the humble toilet paper\nWhere in Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs does toilet paper get a mention? It does not directly meet psychological, safety, love/belonging, esteem or self-actualisation needs. - After all, we were reassured by supermarkets and government that we had plentiful supplies of toilet paper in warehouses across the country and the world. There was never a shortage of toilet paper. So why toilet panic buying?\n\nOpinion\nHuman Behaviour\nHumans, across all layers of society, especially during a pandemic, are essentially selfish (refer below to my skew of Maslow’s version of Humans Hierarchy of Needs, which is Human’s Motivational Drivers Resulting from a Pandemic). They first try to meet their own deep seeded needs, followed by meeting the needs of their loved ones, family, friends etc. When the pandemic became ‘real’, panic buying may seem justifiable to help deal with an individual’s immediate survival needs, but in reality, is more irrational than intelligent. This is what behavioural scientists call Herd Behaviour. This effect is apparent when people do what others are doing instead of using cognition and their own intelligence to make independent decisions. Whilst typically seen in financial stock/security exchange meltdowns, the idea of herding has a long history in philosophy and crowd psychology and would in part explain the toilet paper run. Of course, toilet paper was just the initial irrational buy, other products followed including meat/pasta/flour (various other foods too), refrigerators, sanitisers, gym equipment etc. all devoured within days.\n\nGiven that crowd panic will occur, what are the key takeaways from the experience? How do we prevent similar runs (pardon the pun)? How and who is best placed to manage these types of behaviours? Or do we just let things ride and leave every man, woman and child to fend for themselves?\nThe amount of information that is captured almost instantaneously nowadays is mind-boggling. It defies belief that between:\n\nSocial media networks,\nBanks and financial institutions (I include card schemes VISA, MasterCard, China UnionPay),\nGovernments, and\nTechnology platforms\n\nWe* failed to take ownership of the situation. The data available to all of these groups of organisations was/is incredible and yet panic and anxiety still resulted.\nLet’s put this into some perspective:\n\nSocial platforms know instantaneously through data feeds when panic sets in, or something goes literally ‘viral’\nBanks and financial institutions know in real or near real-time what is being purchased, at which merchants, dollar spend amounts, time of purchase, persona of buyers, product categories acquired etc.\nTechnology platforms and their partners (I include online retailers here, like for example Amazon, eBay, Alibaba etc.) and include Apple, Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Samsung etc. know instantly what is being acquired, what is being said, what people are thinking\nGovernments play multiple roles and have resources to fill the gap of societal failure. Apart from traditional roles like health, welfare, education, defence etc. governments have enough information and power to take the lead where industry and corporations fail.\n\nAn abundance of data is immediately available to limit the amount of panic experienced with COVID-19.  We must not rely on governments alone to face pandemics. This is fraught with dangers. Social platforms, financial institutions, technology platforms along with governments have the responsibility to play a major role in dealing with these types of situations. For example, managing the run on toilet paper, meat and refrigerators can be influenced immediately by the parties mentioned above. They all have the information, smarts and capability to enable a more prudent outcome rather than the resulting commercial feeding frenzy that we saw during the peak of the panic. There were no winners (commercially or socially) as a result of the panic buying of toilet paper and must never be allowed to happen again.\n*I use the word “we” here to cover all people because we all have a say and “we” are in this situation as a collective like it or not.\nBlog Series:\n\nLesson 1 - Response Rates\nLesson 2 - Data Quality\nLesson 3 - Data Democratisation\nLesson 4 - Human Response\nLesson 5 - Contact Tracing\n\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/blog/lesson-4-the-panic-and-human-response-the-toilet-paper-effect/","title":"Lesson 4: The panic and human response - The Toilet Paper Effect"},"https://mondelio.com/blog/lesson-5-digital-contact-tracing-failure-to-deliver/":{"body":"COVID-19 has caused huge disruptions to the way we live our lives.

Data is pivotal in all of the lessons presented. They are brief with factual and personal views. Feel free to comment and contribute.  I am expecting differences of opinion. Some of the topics are somewhat controversial. Some lessons learnt are however plainly obvious.\n\nFacts:\n\nContact tracing has been around for many years. When faced with a deadly disease outbreak, societies have the ability to trace one’s steps to identify who has been in contact or exposed to a person carrying a disease, a virus or some infectious illness.\nThe eradication of smallpox, for example, was achieved not by universal immunisation, but by exhaustive contact tracing to find all infected persons.\nTraditionally it was manual and performing old-school detective work. By finding each sick person and then determining who they recently came into contact with helps get outbreaks of diseases like COVID-19 under control.\nIdentification of an outbreak is typically followed by isolation of infected individuals and immunisation/treatment if available and protecting the surrounding community and contacts at-risk.\n\nThe benefits of contact tracing include:\n\nTo offer early diagnosis and treatment to already infected individuals\nIf the infection is treatable, to help prevent reinfection of the originally infected patient\nTo learn about the epidemiology of a disease in a particular population\n4.To keep the general community at large safe\n\n\nTechnology however has made contact tracing significantly easier. I say this however with some level of trepidation. Technology today is capable of making contact tracing much easier.\nSouth Korea and Taiwan (https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-digital-contact-tracing-slowed-covid-19-in-east-asia) are two countries that have successfully used digital contact tracing to control COVID-19. Both of these countries have learned from more recent epidemics like SARS and MERS and have freely adopted digital contact tracing technology to control the outbreak.\nChina’s app is much stricter than in many other countries. Not only is it mandatory, but tied to a person’s identification (https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/coronavirus-apps-how-australias-covidsafe-compares-to-other-countries-contact-tracing-technology).\n\nOpinion\nDigital Contact Tracing technology does work, as demonstrated by many South East Asian countries. Digital contact tracing is important. It serves to locate COVID-19 hot spots; it identifies carriers and where they have been; it notifies people in close proximity of carriers; and manages/controls the spread.\nIn many western countries, digital contact tracing has been less effective. The adopted technology (like in my native Country Australia - COVIDSAFE) is quite frankly shizen houzen. It does not work – period. Bluetooth technology, on its own, is great for headphones, but terrible for complex digital contact tracing.\nMobile devices embrace many technologies, specifically for tacking and tracing. Technologies include: global positioning systems (GPS), beacons (linked via Bluetooth), telecommunication technology, mobile app data, device data along with other tools can be used to find out where you are, where you’ve been and who was/is around you at the time.\nTo maximise the benefit of these tools, it is the use of a combination of some or all of the above-mentioned instruments that will render benefit for dealing with COVID-19.\nSome (non-technology) reasons for the technology failure include:\n\nBattlegrounds between major technology and data platforms refusing to ‘open their doors’ for good;\nData privacy/data security issues – citizens not trusting governments/technology providers and governments/technology providers not trusting their citizens;\nThe general community refusing to adopt technology for the benefit of the community; and\nGovernments and technology providers not being able to come together to show leadership on an issue that has brought the world to its knees.\n\nIs it possible to make the technology available while still preserving the sensitivities around privacy, data security and proprietary technologies?\nMany will hide behind data security, data privacy, and proprietary technology masks and there will be much finger pointing and yet what we have here is a failure to agree. In the near future, almost every device on earth will be connected to the internet. It is a given that billions of phones, computers, digital watches, digital glasses, body chips, Internet of things (IoT) sensors etc. will mark the maturity of the information age. Let’s accept what is happening. Let’s use technology for good because we can. Let the technology providers, governments and its citizens find some common ground for dealing with these types of global issues.

In the light of day, we will be able to see what we did badly, what we could have done better, and what were the hero acts to inspire.\nWhat could we have done better?\nJust like all events throughout history, once the dust settles, we will have the opportunity to determine what we could have done better. Even now, it’s time to take stock. We can take advantage of some lessons learnt and allow contributions from people at large. It also gives me the chance to formulate some of my own thinking about the events over the past few months and how data and technology are shaping the direction and communication pertaining to the pandemic.\n\nData detail during COVID-19\nI’ll be posting these insights regularly with the first shown below. Data is pivotal in all of the lessons presented. They are brief and personal views. Feel free to comment and contribute. I am expecting differences of opinion. Some of the topics are somewhat controversial. Some lessons learnt are however plainly obvious.\nFacts:\n\nDr. Li Wenliang was the first to alarm the world of the corona virus threat late December even though the first cases started appearing in Wuhan in November 2019. \nChina had the opportunity to react quicker than it did to prevent the outbreak. Dr. Li Wenliang ‘the whistle-blower” was summoned and reprimanded by Chinese authorities for making “untrue” comments, yet once the outbreak was out of control Dr. Li Wenliang (who has since died from the virus) has been labelled a hero for being the first to identify and notify people of the disease.\nAfter the initial stutter, the Chinese government did their own investigation and recognised that COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) was a serious epidemiological risk.\nHaving identified the problem the response was immediate. Little was considered in relation to the economy, or the impact of a lock-down.\nChina’s response was efficient as it was strategic. Lock-out started January 23 2020. Had China acted sooner the global spread would have been substantially less. Chinese - New Year was January 25 2020 (refer to https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_liu_what_the_world_can_learn_from_china_s_response_to_the_coronavirus). The start of mass migration to celebrate the occasion. Had China’s response not happened when it did, the knock-on effects would have been significantly more severe.\nOther countries to have responded successfully, but adopting very different approaches, include South Korea, New Zealand and Singapore. Both currently showing slow or no contraction rates (although, Singapore has subsequently experienced another spike in COVID-19 cases).\nUnfortunately, many European countries (U.K., Italy, Spain, Germany, France) and the USA are now suffering due to what appears to be a lack of initial response to the outbreak.\n\nBut it does raise interesting questions:\n\nWhat data is fact and what data is fiction when it comes to disease and disease control?\nHow different was the COVID-19 outbreak compared to other epidemics?\nWhat sort of response does knowing this elicit and by whom?\nShould governments take immediate action or should they wait until more is known and understood?\n\nIn this somewhat unregulated social media environment, rumours spread (pardon the pun) all of the time. Separating the wheat from the chaff is a challenge for most governments and medical authorities.\nHow to determine fact from fiction\nDr. Li Wenliang posted his alert on the Chinese App WeChat with negative consequences to him and his family, even though in hindsight this was the right thing to do.\nWhy did the onus fall on Dr. Li Wenliang? Shouldn’t the responsibility of such outbreaks fall on health authorities throughout the world? To limit rumours and communication anarchy, announcements of threatening viruses/diseases must come from responsible health authorities nominated by each government. Unfortunately, the World Health Organisation failed in its role due to politics and bureaucracy.\nOpinion:\nWhen it comes to human health there are no “alternative facts”. Nations need to agree (unanimously):\n\nthe process of identifying risky diseases\nthe necessary actions required to minimise deaths and spread\nthe process for accessing reliable data\nprocess for liberating the ownership of data\nconsistent publication of data\n\nBorders don’t matter\nDiseases like this and others, render borders and boundaries impotent. Counties need to set aside all differences to reach resolutions quicker, using all and available data. Together, identify the risky diseases, look at the various solutions and options and considered actions. For diseases like COVID-19 the world needs to think and agree globally but act locally. When it comes to human health, we must work swiftly and together to deal with outbreaks like the COVID-19.

However, everything will eventually get to some normality again. But it will be a new norm.\nData detail during COVID-19\nThis is the second of a series of posts designed to provide insights. They are brief and personal views. Feel free to comment and contribute. I am expecting differences of opinion. Some of the topics are somewhat controversial. Some lessons learnt are however plainly obvious.\n\nFacts:\n\nData shows the Covid 19 virus (that from all accounts) originated in China has been best controlled in that country (South Korea and Singapore have also made great strides in managing the spread of the virus). At least, better than most other countries.\nAuthorities using command and control methodologies moved swiftly to contain and limit the spread. You may have seen videos of people being quickly taken away by Chinese authorities suspected of carrying the virus.\nWhether we like or agree with their methods in this situation, China has implemented an aggressive containment strategy; it locked down cities and transport across the country, grounding tens of millions; factories shut down; schools and offices closed; streets emptied; limiting social activities; and cancelling events etc. confining people to their homes or place of residence.\nSome might call these measures draconian or extreme, yet the numbers appear to show that this approach has controlled the spread. It may appear excessive but it seems to have worked.\nIn contrast, western ‘open’ states have reacted less swiftly. Initial lock-down laws were suggestions rather than directives.\n“Superspreaders” march around cities unbeknown to everyone else of their viral spread.\nTo their detriment, Italians like to embrace, kiss each other on both cheeks and affectionally hold hands when they meet in the street. It’s as much cultural as it is habitual. Being winter in the northern hemisphere also has not helped to contain Covid-19). Other factors including having an older population, poor air quality and the large number of cigarette smokers coupled with the slow response to the pandemic rendered containment obsolete. \nThe USA (and the U.K.) is following the same path although it appears this is due to political and bureaucratic impediments. More will be exposed over the coming weeks and months, but on the surface there appears to be a disconnect between bureaucracies, some incompetence’s and a Republican government wishing/hoping to have some economic stability amongst the turmoil, in the lead-up to the November 2020 elections.\nTravellers from all over the globe have rendered any control or containment obsolete. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy indicated that a large percentage of the spread here in Australia originate from people returning/coming from overseas, or from people in direct contact with people from overseas. Recent measures to quarantine and or isolate travellers will abate the spread, but the amount of damage already incurred is yet unknown.\n\nOpinion:\nThis pandemic is a complex set of affairs affecting everything and everyone alike. From the information and data presented, more (not less) draconian command and control measures are prudent courses of action. This compares to a slower, more measured, open, consultative, ‘democratic’ method. Whilst not the most agreeable approach by democratic societies, command and control is proven to be more effective in cases like this where disease spread is exponential.\nTough love\nBeing decisive and showing leadership is what citizens need, even demand, during crisis moments. Command and control can be exercised, but in a humane, communicative way, (even though some people might not like it). Being transparent (with accurate, consistent and relevant data) while treating humans with dignity and respect, allow authorities (and are given permission) to exercise tough love. With Covid-19 social distancing and isolation are an act or love (Ellen van Neerven on social isolation).\nBlog Series:\n\nLesson 1 - Response Rates\nLesson 2 - Data Quality\nLesson 3 - Data Democratisation\nLesson 4 - Human Response\nLesson 5 - Contact Tracing\n\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/blog/lessons-from-a-pandemic-goodatabadata-lesson-2/","title":"Lessons from a Pandemic - GooDataBaData (Lesson-2)"},"https://mondelio.com/blog/when-it-comes-to-data-more-is-not-always-merrier/":{"body":"Data cleansing is rapidly becoming more difficult and expensive.

This bumps up costs by reducing productivity and allowing erroneous data to enter the system.\nInstead, there should be a single version of the truth with the underlying data stored centrally in a full atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) compliant database that is accessed remotely.\nACID compliance guarantees the validity of the data even if there’s a sub-system or entire system failure.\n4. Detailed Audit Trail\nA good Budgeting and Forecasting solution should be able to answer “who changed which data at what time?”  This comes via a detailed audit trail which can report on various levels of granularity.\nWhen an undesirable situation arises, the audit trail helps investigate the issue by tracing back the steps. It also keeps employees responsible and accountable for their actions and helps revert and restore the system back to the last known good state. \n5. What-If Analysis\nWhat-If Analysis helps organisations model their business financials on multiple possible scenarios in parallel. Each scenario can be independent and predict totally different outcomes. It can be a powerful tool to simulate the effects of multiple changing variables on a business.\nA flexible Budgeting and Forecasting solution should create scenarios based on existing ones, change drivers and variables to provide predicted budget figures based on those particular settings.\nThere you have it. Your 5 essentials.\nSo, in a nutshell, a robust Budgeting and Forecasting system should:\n\nStreamline the budgeting process by following a structured process to save time and costs.\nAlways separate data from logic to promote data integrity and help management make more accurate decisions.\nHave a single version of truth to prevent duplication, promote user productivity and avoid possible errors.\nFacilitate transparency and enforce accountability via a detailed audit trail and granular reporting.\nEquip users with robust ‘What-If Analysis’ to model their business financials on multiple possible scenarios in parallel.\n\nIf you like to see Mondelio in action, please hit the button below:\nBook a Demo\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/blog/your-5-essentials-when-it-comes-to-budgeting-and-forecasting-solution/","title":"Your 5 essentials when it comes to Budgeting and Forecasting solution."},"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/":{"body":"","id":"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/","title":"Business Intelligence & Data Analytics"},"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/analytics-and-high-performance-data-warehouses/":{"body":"More data, more problems\nThe rise of cloud computing has led to an increase in complexity for businesses. Your company probably has data in a wide variety of locations: on-premises and a couple of different cloud sources. How do you create a unified strategy for data spread across all those locations? What about empowering individuals and teams to pull insights out of that data? How are you handling live data sources with constantly updating streams of information?\n\nThese questions might have your head spinning. It’s hard to answer just one, let alone all of them in conjunction — especially if you’re already in the midst of a digital transformation or cloud migration (or both). Trying to keep your business running smoothly during these monumental, years-long evolutions while simultaneously laying the foundation for a stronger tomorrow is a huge task. The right analytics and business intelligence (BI) platform can help with all these issues and leave you in the strongest possible position post-transformation, opening the door for incredible new insights from advanced analytics with Python and R.\nIn this ebook, we’ll dig into digital transformations and cloud migrations, connecting to high-performance data warehouses, using a semantic layer for interacting with your data, building materialized views and optimizing them for analytics. In the end, we’ll look at using materialized views to build advanced models with Python and R.\nDigital transformations and cloud migrations\nThe business world is constantly changing and the pace of those changes is accelerating faster than ever. You need to evolve to keep up. If your business isn’t already undergoing a digital transformation, you’d better be gearing up for one. For a mature enterprise, a digital transformation is a multiyear process that includes a cloud migration to help make data more accessible and portable.\nDigital transformations typically encompass a few key elements: putting analytics in the hands of everyone throughout the company, building analytics into the product offering, and monetizing data. The right analytics and BI platform can help immensely with this process: serving as a semantic layer over the data (both while it’s being moved and once it’s at the destination), then allowing for in-database preparation and optimization for speedier standard analytics and even advanced analytics with Python and R. Your analytics and BI platform lays the foundation for the future of your data-driven business.\nAnalytics for all\nOrganizations know that they need to be data-driven to beat their competition. This means giving every team member access to on-demand analytics to make smart decisions based on timely data — including live data. Users from every business team need to be empowered to dig into the KPIs that matter most to them via an interface that anyone can use without typing code. Inserting analytics and actions directly into existing workflows will also improve adoption rates and ease the burden of learning a new system.\nThe age of analytic apps\nIf you don’t have analytics in your application, you’re behind the curve. Users want to quantify the ways in which they’re using your service. Adding analytics to your product, no matter what it is, increases stickiness, keeps users engaged, and helps them understand the value they get from your product. It also differentiates your product in the marketplace and lays the groundwork for monetizing that data. Analytic apps aren’t just for customer-facing apps, they can also change the way your in-house teams work by putting insights and actions right next to each other. Individual decision-makers should be viewing data on the same platforms they’re already utilizing to act on that information. These analytic apps will be powered by your data warehouse and other cloud sources.\nMonetizing your data\nWhat does your company do? Whatever the first answer was to pop in your head, the real answer is: you are a data company (or you will be, very soon). Adding analytics to your product is a necessary step if you want to monetize that data. Data is the new oil, meaning your company is probably sitting on a vast reserve of this valuable resource and needs to create processes to turn it into revenue. Selling users enhanced insights based on their data, as well as leveraging that data in other products or in partnerships with other companies are all powerful ways that modern companies are finding new sources of recurring revenue. \nGetting live data from a high-performance data warehouse\nYour company’s cloud migration can be a part of a larger digital transformation, but it’s also vital to your company’s success in the competitive modern cloud-based environment. Having all your data in the cloud lets anyone access the information they need from anywhere, control costs by only paying for the storage and processing power you need when you need it, and seamlessly autoscale your core application software.\nYour analytics and BI platform is the key to making this migration smooth, keeping information accessible throughout and laying the foundation for your business’s future. The platform is especially helpful when serving as a semantic layer over the data as well as connecting to your high-performance data warehouse and allowing you to perform complex analyses with live and cached data in the same dashboard. If your platform offers materialized views, it can take your analytics to new heights by allowing your team to prep and optimize data in-warehouse while also priming it for advanced analytics (more on that later).\nThe semantic layer\nYou’ve got data, lots of it, and you want to get it onto the cloud so that you can do more with it. How do you keep your frontline business users empowered with the data they need while you’re busy moving that data? The right data and analytics platform will serve as a semantic layer over your data, allowing your team to run the queries they need, no matter where the data is. It also allows you to build durable, versatile data models that everyone in your company can use to perform their analysis. The data in these models is already cleaned and modeled. Secure access can be programmatically controlled so that no one can see anything they’re not cleared for and no one can break the model.\nAnother really powerful semantic layer function is allowing users to perform complex analyses and create dashboards that include live data from your warehouse alongside cached data from any source. The business world moves incredibly fast and you can’t afford to wait for data availability to make decisions. Going strictly off of cached, historical data puts you at a disadvantage. A semantic layer that gives you access to live and cached data squares this circle. It can even save you money, since you control when and how often you query the live data warehouse (very useful if you’re paying per compute).\nMaterialized views: optimizing for analytics\nIf the semantic layer sits above your data, empowering users across your organization with analytics and insights, then the materialized view lives in your data warehouse and sets the stage for optimized analytics. These views leverage the skills of data engineers and other cloud data experts who can use SQL to clean and transform the data in-warehouse. Your materialized view can even preemptively perform certain aspects of your analysis and keep the results handy, speeding up and optimizing future queries. Once you’ve migrated all your data to your high-performance cloud data warehouse, a materialized view will help you get insights even more quickly. It even speeds up the sharing of those insights wherever you need them: to in-house users or customers via embedded apps in your software. That’s just the beginning of the game-changing nature of the materialized view.\nUsing materialized views for advanced analytics (Python and R)\nHigh-performance data warehouses are great. They store all your data, however it comes in, and connect easily to modern analytics and BI platforms. However, all this data is not useful in its raw form. That’s where your materialized view becomes so vital: once the data is cleaned and prepped, it can be modeled for more complex and useful analysis with help from machine learning (ML) systems. \nIn your materialized view, data engineers and data scientists can use Python and R for advanced statistical modeling like answering predictive questions. These languages even set the stage for machine learning capabilities like sentiment analysis on text (consumer reviews, social media, etc.). Since all the data cleaning and prep has already happened in the data warehouse, you don’t need to pipe the data to a new location; you can use Python and R as a data frame and model your data via libraries and packages you’re already familiar with.\nWhat form this next level of analysis takes will depend on the questions you’re trying to answer: Do you want to dig through tweets aimed at your customer service account and see what the most common complaints are so that you can head them off in the future? Or maybe you have a deep well of sales data and you want to understand where you’re getting the most value and how your customer base is changing so that you can focus your efforts on a growing client segment. Whatever questions you decide to answer, your analytics and BI system helps turn your newly modeled data into visualizations that you can send directly to dashboards or analytic apps. Materialized views with Python and R are your gateway to answering game-changing questions.\nBuilding the future: advanced analytics and beyond\nWe live in a cloud world. As you migrate your data and undergo or finalize your digital transformation, you’re not just looking to carry on with business as usual. This is your chance to build something new and different to set the stage for your company to own the future of your industry. Choosing a cloud-native analytics platform, storing your data in high-performance data warehouses, and using materialized views to enable advanced analytics on your ever-increasing stores of data are just a few ways that the right technology choices at this crucial time in your company’s development will make a huge difference down the road. You can’t build something that will last if your foundation is shaky. Make Sisense part of your foundation and build boldly, knowing you have the tools and support you need to make real whatever you can dream up.\nTry Sisense\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/analytics-and-high-performance-data-warehouses/","title":"Analytics and High-Performance Data Warehouses"},"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/better-customer-health-through-data-analysis/":{"body":"For customer success teams, the only constant is change — new business priorities, new processes, new product features, new customer objectives, etc. The best success teams put strategies and processes in place to identify key metrics, prioritize operations and scale effectively. The reward for managing it all correctly is happy, loyal, and profitable customers.\nModern customer success teams are swimming in data: product usage data, account data, user data, billing data, etc. All that information comes from different places and isn’t structured in a way that makes it easily understandable. Organizing it all into a single location is a chance for an opportunistic team to understand the overall customer experience and provide proactive recommendations throughout the relationship. But without the right strategy, that analysis can be overwhelming and distracting. \n\nWhen customers consider and ultimately purchase a product, they’re expecting to enter into a relationship where they are cared for and supported. The right way to provide that support is to understand their use cases and specific product usage, then translate those insights into actions and recommendations to enhance their experience. When there is a clear strategy to make analysis actionable, data can be the simplest way to nurture those relationships and grow a business. \nThe bigger purpose of a customer success team involves a lot of personal touches, but there’s still a significant advantage for a team that can manage data properly. If your team hasn’t already ironed out a process to collect and analyze customer data, it’s time to start the conversation. Here are some ideas from our world-class customer success team that will help sort through the flood of information and turn customer data into proactive recommendations. \nAs the Data Expands, Narrow Your Focus\nToday, the rapid pace of incoming data (and changes to that data) is an easy place to get distracted; it’s important to step back and refocus on the top priority — the customers. Ultimately, the best customer success teams will drive positive outcomes by examining all of that shifting data and deciding which pieces of information should be analyzed and which are noise. \nSince the industry is moving so rapidly, the winners will be the teams that can identify and prioritize the right data to drive their actions. Though it seems counterintuitive, the best response to the rush of available analytics is actually to narrow the scope of analysis, focusing closely on specific KPIs in order to maintain flexibility. \nUnderstand What Moves the Data That Matters\nAs a customer success leader, the first priority in surviving the rate of change is to identify which KPIs matter. Some of the classics like retention, adoption, and renewal rates are always going to be important, but organizations can also determine their own unique cornerstone statistics (active users, support interactions, etc.) based on product offerings and industry. A good place to start when determining these crucial KPIs is to ask why the customer success team exists. Are these employees there to maximize retention and minimize churn? To increase upsell? What about cross-sell? Whatever the team’s objectives are, focus on finding the levers that influence those crucial KPIs. \nSome might be obvious (such as NPS score), but combining disparate data points can surface deeper insights that move the needle on those valuable top-level KPIs. More data-driven organizations prioritize analysis that learns what will have the greatest impact now and utilize machine learning to systematically predict future customer activities. \nOnce the crucial KPIs have been identified and paired with likely correlations, customer success managers can prioritize these influential activities. In a landscape that changes so frequently, it’s imperative to have a structure that enables vital data about customers to flow to the success team as quickly as possible. This approach changes the focus of the individual success managers away from a reactive, fire-fighting mindset and empowers them to be more proactive. \nA success team that implements this strategy of focusing on important metrics, determining the best ways to influence them, and then scaling those practices across customers are set up for better customer relationships. The entire process is predicated on having accurate, up-to-date customer information, then turning it into insights and executing them. Inaccurate or outdated data can negatively impact customer relationships and result in lost business opportunities. Even if a team has optimized their workflow and tuned processes to achieve maximum efficiency, bad data can turn these well-intentioned communications into spam. \nA unified data platform should solve this problem by connecting disparate sources of customer data and ensuring unquestioned data integrity. The team can determine the metrics that are crucial to customer success, create a customer health score or prioritization dashboard for those metrics, and focus their time on high-value opportunities. \nUse a Data Platform That Adapts To the Speed of Change\nUltimately, a customer success team’s speed is heavily influenced by their tools and processes. At Sisense, we use our own product to optimize customer success. We were delighted by the easy implementation when we had to navigate a change in corporate systems. Not long ago, we went through a period of simultaneously switching billing and ticketing providers, two key parts of our overall customer health score. With another platform, this would require months of reimplementation, but we connected the new solutions into our standard dashboard and had the health scores sorted out in less than a week. We adjusted on the fly, without a need to update schemas or reconfigure our scoring. Better yet, we never lowered the bar for the service that we provided to our customers. \nThis type of platform means customer success teams can access and analyze data, test a hypothesis, rapidly iterate on ideas, and scale the solution to the rest of the team. This model-as-you-go strategy allows teams to ensure accuracy with customer information, pinpoint retention or upsell opportunities and reduce the effort put into baseline reporting. \nWith a dynamic data platform like this, successful leaders can measure current customer health, forecast the future growth, segment the base into appropriate cohorts, and manage communications more effectively. The effect is better management of outcomes, both for your customers and your own business. \nWhat’s Next in Health Data Analytics?\nThe only solution to the changing customer success landscape is a strategy that enables a team to evolve at an accelerated rate. It can be easy to get lost in the stream of incoming data, but the best teams will maintain focus on the important customer KPIs. With a unified goal, all that incoming data can be used to experiment and find new avenues to improve relationships. The success team exists to ensure that customers are getting the most out of their experiences so that the team should be set up to measure and deliver exactly that. \nIf you want to see how your customer success team can use data to improve net retention, set up a free trial of Sisense for Cloud Data Teams.

At the end of 2018, the adoption of Big Data in enterprises reached 59%, with a compound annual growth rate of 36%. This trend will continue to accelerate, powered by the ascendancy of cloud-based data warehousing, analytics platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. Adoption rates like these indicate that Big Data and analytics usage are now mainstream.\n\nThis trend adds a new chapter to a constant challenge for all organizations: how to maintain a competitive advantage in their industry. When competitors are jumping on board the data train, what can organizations do to stay ahead of them? The answer is simple. They must continue to adopt the most advanced analytics platforms, processes, and tools to future-proof their business. By harnessing the power of advanced analytics, they can drive the next wave of digital transformation that will enable them not only to handle current conditions but also to anticipate and shape the future.\nIn this paper, we consider how BI and analytics will deliver this promise and what strategies the next generation of data-driven businesses will implement. Read on to find out about two of the most innovative technological developments that will empower business analysts to unleash the power of data science so that they can improve future outcomes using today’s data.\nThe rise of Artificial Intelligence. What does it mean for you?\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) provides a new level of understanding that extends what existing analytics platforms can achieve. That’s because platforms with AI can learn from the patterns of data they analyze. AI can extrapolate insights and suggest new phenomena that may not have been anticipated. It can be leveraged to power exploration widgets and drill down deeper into data to answer business questions — current and even unasked.\nAI algorithms scan entire databases and make suggestions based on both analysis and the usage patterns of dashboard users. As AI algorithms collect more input from users’ activity, their suggestions will become more accurately targeted to users’ needs.\nThe result is advanced forecasting capabilities and a new way of working for business analysts. Using AI, analysts can become more focused on forward-thinking scenario planning, asking what-if questions of the data, rather than simply analyzing current or previous trends. With this capability, analysts can sharpen their organizations’ competitive edge by identifying future KPIs and improving outcomes. Furthermore, this can be achieved in real time and without hard coding skills to instantaneously deliver new answers to the questions users have in mind when they want to uncover fresher and deeper insights directly within dashboards.\nMindful of these capabilities, data mining, advanced algorithms, and predictive analytics are among the highest-priority projects for enterprises adopting AI and machine learning (ML). Already, 40% of marketing and sales teams say that data science including AI and ML is critical to their success. Sales and marketing share high levels of interest in their efforts to define new revenue growth models using AI and ML. Furthermore, according to Dresner’s 2019 Data Science and Machine Learning Market Study, 70% of R&amp;D departments and teams are most likely to adopt data science, AI, and ML, leading all functions in an enterprise. This level of interest strongly indicates broader enterprise adoption in the future. \nTaking the weight of your data\nAI can also be used to facilitate and expedite the analysis of data, empowering analysts to reach insights in real time and accelerate decision making. It achieves this by taking the weight of your data. \nThe volume of data is growing exponentially. To keep pace with this growth, BI and analytics platforms need to categorize, manage, and analyze ever larger and more complex datasets, and do all of it faster than ever. AI engines automate a considerable part of this process because they are capable of tirelessly analyzing huge datasets from any source and in any format. AI doesn’t require data engineers to manually categorize, organize, and identify patterns in data. It learns emerging patterns and builds on what it has learned. Moreover, it can learn and recommend ways of using data from different users — both individuals and groups — that human analysts may not have considered. AI minimizes the need for time-consuming, tedious, and cumbersome tasks so that the skills of data teams can be used more productively.\nIn the process of identifying these patterns, AI engines enhance the data team’s ability to discover anomalous behaviors and causes based on the analysis of historical data patterns. With that information, data teams can minimize or capitalize on anomalies at the right time to deliver beneficial business outcomes. Data that shows both regularities and outliers can be instructive in forming insights and developing strategies to drive a business or raise new questions to take strategy in new directions. AI and ML make data and insights accessible, however complex its raw form is, and empower users to build dashboards, analytic apps and widgets of their own to harness the data’s full potential. All of these tools combine to deliver a guided experience that will make it easier for even a novice to gain a deeper understanding of their business.\nMaking AI ubiquitous\nWith all these benefits, it stands to reason that the best way to maximize the value of data is to integrate AI into every aspect of the BI lifecycle; starting with the preparation and cleansing of data, through to delivering key insights and hidden patterns to end-users. Therefore, the ideal situation is to embed AI capabilities into each facet of a BI platform, so that everyone within an organization can experience the capabilities of AI and ML to streamline or reduce manual processes and get new insights.\nConsider the power of the insights and the potential outcomes that could be gleaned from an “AI Throughout” approach — terabytes of rich usage metadata stored on the cloud and spanning use cases, industries, and user profiles. It’s information that could drive the development of user experiences that are more tailored, personalized, and relevant than ever.\nWith AI-assisted data preparation and modeling, it will be possible to reduce the time it takes for business analysts to build complex data models. Looking forward, AI-assisted data modeling will empower builders with less database administration expertise to make data models and avoid common pitfalls by offering suggestions during the modeling process.\nBy weaving AI throughout, builders will also be empowered to deliver analytics in a variety of ways, tailored to any situation. Analytics will be integrated into a user’s workflow through embedded analytics and by adding workflow and actionable components to dashboards. By guiding and supporting users, AI will bring value to organizations that goes beyond dashboards and self-service BI to the deployment of embedded, AI-powered analytic apps that create data experiences users will love.\nCreating a cultural shift – from reactive to proactive\nWhat arises from the new approach to AI enablement is augmented insights: instant and actionable at just a click. That gives analysts and users without data science skills the ability to immediately discern trends and patterns in their data, predict future outcomes, and make decisions that drive business value. Soon, business analysts will have forecasting capabilities — the ability to deploy advanced predictive data models to any KPI based on current data.\nAt the heart of this is a move from a reactive, historical data perspective to a proactive, future-focused mindset, as AI enables predictive analytics that delivers a more accurate assessment of what will happen in the future. With AI everywhere, organizations can feel more confident that they’re making the best possible business decisions; not just in response to what’s happening, but in anticipation of what will happen. Changing this perspective creates a powerful point of difference and a strong competitive edge for any business.\nThe quest to simplify AI\nBuilding this advanced AI environment isn’t easy, but it’s hugely valuable. Maximizing AI’s value comes from increasing engagement throughout your organization, by making the process of integrating and using AI as simple as possible, and by optimizing its impact on decision making.\nAI needs to be actionable in a low-code environment, so users can seamlessly implement specific recommendations at the point of insight. Accomplishing this involves evolving dashboards into AI analytic apps, and delivering these advanced analytic apps in a visual, interactive way. After that, historical data and predictive analytics come to life in an easily comprehensible format, making insights, potential outcomes, and decisions as accessible and as understandable as possible for more users.\nThe type of tools necessary to make this happen are:\n\nLibraries of out-of-the-box statistical models that deliver new insights from existing KPIs\nCustom ML models deployed by uploading a single Python script\nSuggested actions for each app, or the creation of new ones tailored to specific use cases\nStatistical analysis and advanced forecasting capabilities within a menu-driven, point-and-click-interface\n\nThe result is that business analysts can deliver the most relevant, tailored user experience to their colleagues, harnessing the power of data science for all. With these kinds of tools, analysts can integrate predictive analytics and deliver customized, impactful actions that users can take at the point of insight, not just for today, but to shape the future of their business. AI is the future that gives more insights to everyone and further power to the builders.\nSee Sisense in Action\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/business-analysts-and-ai-answering-your-questions-before-asking/","title":"Business Analysts and AI — Answering Your Analytics Questions Before Asking"},"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/data-management-in-the-multicloud-analytics-era/":{"body":"What comes after big data?\nOver the last decade, data has done more than explode, it’s completely changed the way companies operate. When technology made it not only affordable, but advantageous to store a wide variety of information, Big Data took the business world by storm. Once all of that data was wrangled and stored, organizations of all sizes collectively came to terms with a new challenge: creating value with all of that information. The truth is that the ambition to collect data had far outpaced business’s abilities to analyze it. Organizations across all industries had an extremely wide range of data inputs and an equally distributed approach to storing all that data. \n\nCoinciding with the sharp increase in data collection was another trend: cloud storage. \nOrganizations today use a mixture of on-prem, public cloud, and private cloud environments to manage their data. Depending on their unique data needs, teams are faced with the challenge of incorporating all of those technologies together into a data pipeline that can be used to answer more and more complex business questions. This type of setup, merging different cloud technologies together into a single workflow is called a multicloud architecture.\nSolving the traditional reliability/agility tradeoff\nTraditionally, data infrastructure has been designed to deliver either reliability or agility. Being able to move quickly with data meant sacrificing uptime. Having a stable data environment limited a team’s ability to respond to change. Before multicloud infrastructures, data stacks existed somewhere on a spectrum with reliability at one end and agility at the other. Movement toward one end was also an equal move away from the other.\nWith the introduction of cloud-native strategies, that linear spectrum has turned into a quadrant, with the possibility of a position that optimizes both reliability and agility. Organizations that effectively structure multicloud environments benefit from both excellent performance and the ability to innovate quickly to adapt to changing market or customer demands.\nThe introduction of cloud-native techniques has brought on a development process that operates more like the traditional DevOps process used in software engineering functions. Cloud-based microservices in containers give teams flexibility that had never been possible before. There’s an easy-to-see future where data teams take advantage of this structure to deliver advanced data insights to stakeholders in real time. This ideal multicloud structure offers data teams a lot of attractive benefits: faster time to turn data into value, optimized costs, increased business agility, productivity optimizations, and a more robust end-user experience.\n“Multicloud” vs. “cloud agnostic”\nWhen it comes to generating value from different cloud providers, “multicloud” is a bit of a misnomer. It’s unrealistic to try to design a cloud environment that uses a little bit of each of the three big cloud providers, combining specific parts of each to build the most complete full stack. The costs of transferring data from one cloud to another make that structure unattractive. \nInstead, the most innovative modern organizations are building stacks that can operate smoothly in any of the big cloud providers. A cloud-agnostic stack runs efficiently on any of the three big cloud vendors, but can easily be moved together as a unit to any of the other vendors if that shift becomes advantageous for the business. When we talk about the benefits of a “multicloud” stack, what we really mean is a stack that can run holistically on multiple cloud vendors and incorporate on-prem elements, not one that runs on multiple clouds at the same time. \nIn short, “multicloud” is about portability. The value of the multicloud architecture is not generated from a wide stack that spans different cloud vendors, it’s from a vertical stack that can move laterally to any single cloud vendor whenever the CIO determines that move to be advantageous. \nComplications of a multicloud environment\nA multicloud architecture offers a lot of advantages when it is executed well, but it’s not as easy as simply flipping a switch. The reliable and agile system described in the previous section is a desirable end state, but one that has several obstacles along the way, especially for companies with data infrastructures that predate cloud technology. Here are a few of the biggest blockers for modern companies that want to adopt a multicloud strategy:\n\nComplexity/latency: Data comes from a lot of different sources and lives in a lot of different places, including different cloud environments. Moving all that data from place to place requires additional work from the data team and can introduce room for error with data dependencies or latency.\nExisting data infrastructure: A stack of data tools that are entirely cloud-native is great, but most organizations began building their stacks long before cloud technology was possible. Because of the connectivity required of each part of a stack, combining tools with varying levels of cloud accessibility is not always easy or even possible.\nCompliance: With new technology often comes new regulations to ensure that data is both protected and used appropriately. When new compliance measures are passed, companies have to invest a lot of resources in meeting those requirements.\nSecurity: Adding new cloud technology can also be an easy way to introduce new threats to the security of your data. Organizations need to make sure that they have sufficient security practices in place before building a multicloud stack. \nCost: Adopting new technologies, even if they are improvements, often means purchasing new tools and laying the groundwork for them to work together. While the end result can offer significant cost reductions, the expenses of the upfront structural work can still be prohibitive for some companies.\n\nThe current cloud landscape\nToday’s cloud landscape has three major players: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. From a cost perspective, it’s relatively affordable to transfer data inside a single cloud provider and relatively expensive to transfer data from one cloud to another. Those three platforms do a great job spinning up more and more targeted services for their customers to get more valuable experience from a single provider, but it’s still rare that an organization can find a single cloud provider to manage every part of their data stack.\nWhile a single provider can provide robust in-cloud data environments, moving all of an organization’s data to a single cloud provider can create a dependency on that cloud. This is a dilemma for CIOs. The value of having a single cloud provider for an entire stack needs to be balanced against the threat of becoming beholden to that specific vendor. Forward-looking CIOs have to keep an eye on how agile their stack can be and construct their architecture in a way that makes it easily transferred from one cloud to another if that becomes necessary.\n“Cloud-ready” vs. “cloud-native”\nWhen discussing cloud technologies, it’s important to understand the difference between “cloud-ready” tools and “cloud-native” ones. Understanding those classifications is the only way to truly understand the relationships between tools in your stack and build something that takes advantage of all that multicloud has to offer. Here’s a short explanation: cloud-ready tools can run on the cloud in a limited capacity; cloud-native tools are intended to perform in a cloud environment in conjunction with other cloud-native technology. Cloud-ready technology might be able to emulate cloud-native tools, but the lack of nuanced scalability seen in cloud-native architectures prevents cloud-ready options from being genuinely considered equal.\nCloud-native technology is set apart largely because of microservices architectures that are readily supported via Kubernetes, running on Linux (which has become the default operating system for the cloud). Applications built to run on a Kubernetes stack are portable — they will run on a single laptop or on a much more powerful AWS-backed collection of resources. Cloud-ready tools that were built to run on a laptop or an on-prem box might be able to run in the cloud on a single virtual machine, but that sacrifices all of the fine-grain scalability that makes multicloud valuable. \nCloud-ready vendors offer limited functionality if you’re building a system that utilizes the full extent of multicloud technology. Consider a tool that was originally built for on-prem or outdated private clouds: That tool might be able to produce data that can be added to your cloud stack with read-only functionality, but if the rest of the pieces in your stack can all load data into the cloud, transform it there, and write back to other sources, your cloud-ready tool is already outdated and will only fall further behind as more cloud-native tools are added to that environment.\nBuilding a stack of all cloud-native tools is the easiest way to make sure your data infrastructure is up-to-date. Depending on your organization’s unique data inputs and outputs, it’s possible to have a fully functional stack that includes a single piece of cloud-ready technology, but as you try to fit more and more of those pieces together, the difficulties compound and the performance of your system suffers.\nBuilding a cloud-native stack\nUltimately, the choice about whether a tool is cloud-native or merely cloud-ready is one that is made by the vendor, not the customer. The decision to build a fully portable, cloud-native data infrastructure is one that an organization needs to make before it starts looking for tools to buy. To build the most modern cloud architecture, buyers need to make cloud-native structure a requirement for their vendor options.\nBuilding a stack with some cloud-ready vendors might seem like a viable option at first, but if the data team makes a decision to move their data from one cloud to another, that technology is going to prove problematic. For example, a tool like Tableau is built to run on-prem but can be cloud-ready in a multicloud stack. It might be functional to run in the cloud because of workarounds that you can build, but that limits how much a team can take advantage of the flexibility that comes with a true multicloud setup. \nCloud-Native Sisense\nSisense’s cloud-native solution is built to give data teams the most flexibility in their multicloud stack. That architecture is built for Linux and runs on Kubernetes and Docker, using container-based microservices to deliver its benefits. That Kubernetes architecture allows organizations to use resources efficiently, coordinating the scaling and management of microservice lifecycles effortlessly without the complex server management needs of a legacy approach. \nSince all of today’s major cloud offerings run on Linux and support Kubernetes technology, Sisense can be a part of the most modern portable multicloud stack. It’s fully self-contained in a portable environment that operates the same no matter where your team needs it to run. Cloud-Native Sisense runs smoothly on a single stack with any of the three major cloud providers or on a custom Sisense Managed Cloud stack that a data team has tailored to its specific needs.\nThis incredibly agile tool fits seamlessly into any team’s Infrastructure-as-Code and DevOps processes, making it easier and faster to provision, upgrade, and scale nodes when needed. It also scales to suit the needs of any data team’s workflow, which allows companies to use their resources more efficiently and reduce the system’s TCO.\nHowever your organization approaches the multicloud landscape, Cloud-Native Sisense can help modernize your data stack.

There are four key approaches, each with their own unique business benefits. So, how do you know which is right for your organisation? Read on to find out.\nThe 4 different types of Business Analytics\n\nDescriptive Analytics\nDiagnostic Analytics\nPredictive Analytics\nPrescriptive Analytics\n\nWhat they mean in plain English\n\nWhat happened?\nWhy did it happen?\nWhat will happen?\nHow can we make it happen?\n\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/how-can-business-analytics-benefit-your-organisation/","title":"How can Business Analytics benefit your organisation?"},"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/sisense-data-and-analytics-trends/":{"body":"Introduction - Building Better Companies with Data\nIt's a fascinating time to be in the data and analytics space. Companies are more aware than ever of the impact data can have on their business. This year, our tried and true predictions that we have been making for some time now are coming true right before our very eyes — every company is becoming a data company. \nIn the coming years, the true value of data will be realized and companies will adjust their business in anticipation of this value. Data will drive processes and operations through analytics and BI. Developers and data teams will emerge and create clear and efficient insights that will drive decisions. Analysts and business users will be handed coherent answers from complex data queries that will lead the way to more successful businesses.\n\nAt Sisense, we have very forward-looking leaders, innovators, and data professionals working full time on a vision toward building the future. In our newest trends guide — Data and Analytics Trends for 2020 (and 2030!) — we give you our predictions about what will happen in 2020, and what the data landscape will look like in 2030.\nBI Consolidation\n\n\n2020 - The BI Industry Will Consolidate Into a Handful of Single Stack Options\nEmbedded analytics have been gradually creeping into more and more of our tools for the past few years, but in 2019, we’ll see analytics incorporated into pretty much all the software we use. We’ll be able to analyze the swathes of data produced by our digital worlds and the software we use and packaging it into something we can make sense of—and act on—immediately.\nThere’s a rhythm to the BI industry that alternates between periods of bundling and unbundling. Around 20 years ago, there were a few big monolithic platforms where most companies did their BI analysis — MicroStrategy, Business Objects, and Cognos. At a point in the early 2000s, different point solutions began to spring up to provide superior tools for individual parts of that process — visualization, data science, warehousing, ETL. For example, Tableau is great at visualization, so companies began to build stacks that incorporated Tableau to their existing monolithic stack. Once Tableau emerged, there was an opportunity for vendors like Qlik and Power BI to grow. Those point solutions are all great at what they do, but a data stack that involves too many one-off additions introduces room for error and runs into scalability and consistency issues.\nWhat we started to see in 2019 was a motion to combine several of the more popular point solutions into larger stacks. Google acquired Looker, Salesforce acquired Tableau, and Sisense merged with Periscope Data. This is a trend that will continue for the next few years until a few major players emerge as viable end-to-end solutions. The point solutions that teams love today will likely be merged into one of those big stacks or forced into a very difficult independent route.\nFor BI buyers, this means that the long-term BI stack options will be reduced. It also means that the packages will include an entire suite of tools and a buyer will need to be comfortable using each of those tools. As the industry continues bundling, organizations will buy one of the new monoliths; it will no longer be a tenable solution to customize a BI stack with a combination of preferred point solutions.\n2030 - New BI Technology Will Introduce a Period of Unbundling\nIt’s a very interesting thought experiment to imagine what technology will drive the next round of unbundling. Will it be AI, new analysis or interaction methods, virtual reality, or something we can’t even imagine today? By 2030, it will be about the right time for this new technological breakthrough to occur. From a BI stack standpoint, this new technology will be so valuable that some organizations will break their existing monolithic stack to incorporate it as a point solution.\nOnce that breakthrough technology has been established, other tools will be created that work in conjunction with or compete against it. There may be an entirely new industry that appears based on this one big new innovation. As new layers are added to that technology, it opens the door for another round of stack unbundling to begin.\nProduct Management\n\n\n2020 - Product Management Will Turn Into a Test-Driven Process\nThe traditional (flawed) method of improving a product has been to talk to customers and observe market trends before synthesizing a hypothesis based on those anecdotes. From there, a small amount of data is usually hand-chosen to support the conclusion that a product manager has already determined. This approach occasionally results in good decisions but has obvious downfalls. \nThe products that are truly winning with data today are revolutionizing the product improvement process by shifting to a methodology that starts with initial hypotheses and executes a series of tests to conclusively determine an effect. Once a hypothesis becomes a quantifiable insight instead of just a hunch, it’s easier for a product team to invest in the right feature improvements.\nThis new approach is essentially the scientific method of product improvement. The types of people who will succeed in this new environment are those who can effectively translate product questions into highly measurable, single-variant tests with results that clearly verify or reject a hypothesis. These product managers will no longer make suggestions like “I think we should choose color A over color B.” They’ll upgrade those recommendations to “I ran a test and color A resulted in X% more product clicks than color B, so we should prioritize that change.”\n2030 - High Levels of Product Testing and Improvement Will Be Ubiquitous\nIn today’s data environment, it’s relatively expensive to maintain a fully staffed data team to design and run all these tests. As the testing-savvy product managers ascend and the testing technology improves to be more user-friendly for that new audience, the trend will only accelerate further.\nAt a certain point, data will be so massive and the costs of running tests will be so small that a product team will be able to take small chunks of data and conduct conclusive testing in a very short time span. As the cost and time needed to run a test decrease, the number of tests a team can run will increase, so the people and teams running the best tests will very quickly prevail. In 10 years, it’s reasonable to expect that data-driven products will have a roadmap entirely designed by tests like this. \nCustomer Experience\n\n\n2020 - Companies Will Be Hybrid\nData and storage will not be on-premises or cloud, rather a hybrid of the two. When I say hybrid, there are a few dimensions I am talking about:\nData storage will be hybrid — data will be stored both on-premises and in the cloud and companies will be agnostic to a cloud vendor\nProduct features will be hybrid — there will be some product features that work in the cloud, some that work on-premises, and some that work on both \nThere are a few reasons why the hybrid solution will gain popularity. First, by storing data both in the cloud and on-premises, a company can be agnostic to a cloud vendor. With the data and analytics world changing so quickly, you don’t want to tether the entire future of your company to a specific technology or vendor. \nSecond, although cloud implementations are gaining traction, there are very good reasons for some companies to keep their data on-premises. Data security is one of the primary reasons that most companies make that decision. \nHowever, one of the most overlooked benefits of keeping data on-premises, and one that will become very prevalent in the future, is the customer experience. The cloud can only provide so much performance. In order to provide a truly interactive experience with your customer, you need to accelerate the performance of the data, and that means moving it closer to the customer. In other words, you will need to cache certain snippets of data on-premises to meet customers’ growing expectations.\n2030 - Logical Mashup\nData privacy issues will become even more pronounced in the future. We can already see that companies are going to further restrict access to their data sources.  Pulling data directly from separate sources to mash up in a central location will no longer be possible because the risk of a security breach will be a big concern.\nThis is when the use of data federations is going to increase dramatically. Companies will need to use data federations, or query federations, to treat multiple data sources logically — as if they were one source.\nThere are a few companies already starting to develop this type of technology, and we are going to see more of this logical mashup in the future.\nBI Ecosystem\n\n\n2020 - The Rise of the BI Operating System\nAs developers create more experiences related to a company’s data flow, they will begin to enrich the system with analytic apps that reduce the time needed to take actions based on data — actually closing the BI loop. The flow will look like this: Data &gt; Insight &gt; Action &gt; Data. This will transform the traditional dashboard into an operating system that continually drives the business.\nAs this happens, a couple of things will occur:\nUX will be King:\nOnce we master building an analytic app, the next step in that progression will be to build a better app where code and design thinking come together. Once this happens, BI developers will begin to craft experiences that are more appealing, native to the BI platform, and most importantly — effective.\nThe rise of the BI ecosystem:\nWorkflows will begin to feel like one unified system. Users will manage one asset (through the BI and analytics platform) instead of multiple assets.  A unified system will be presented to the user instead of siloed platforms.\n2030 - Autonomous Operating Systems Through Analytics and BI\nIf we consider the next 10 years as a training set for data-driven businesses in a unified environment (using BI apps), we can assume that this process will evolve to produce an autonomous operation system. \nBusiness users will have minimal touches with data. They will spend most of their time asking questions from analytic apps and getting operational data paths in return.\nData experts will handle the quality and integrations that support those operational paths. That setup will deliver the best experience for anyone interacting with the system, a highly customized interface based on a user’s role and specific needs. \nThese autonomous operating systems will reduce the time it takes to look for information (which is around 20-30% in 2019), to a much lower number in 2030. Every minute that can be spent on a novel and operative analysis rather than data “massaging” will translate into an improvement in overall lifestyle and well-being.\nData Storage and Streaming\n\n\n2020 - Operationalizing the Data Lake\nOver the past few years, data lakes have become a more popular way of storing data for most companies. This is due to the massive amounts of data that can be stored at a very low cost and the separation of storage from computing. The data, however, is stored in an unstructured way without a predefined schema and most companies find themselves using less than 10% of their stored data for analytics and BI purposes. \nIn the coming year, we will see more and more companies using existing and emerging technologies and products to make the huge amounts of unused data accessible for any type of analysis - from BI to data science. \nThe new breed of products will include new and improved engines to run queries against the data lake, tools to transform and prepare data in the data lake, tools to move data between environments, and tools to manage the overall data environment, including pipelines, cataloging and RBAC.\n2030 - Streaming Analysis will Become an Analytics Service\nStreaming Analytics allows companies to analyze data as soon as it becomes available, significantly enhancing real-time analytics. \nThis is a very difficult level of BI. Think of Uber trying to pick your driver in seconds from hundreds of choices. Until now, this has been a complicated process involving a full back-end team of DevOps and data engineers to constantly monitor and manipulate the data so that real-time data can be acted upon at any given moment.\nOver the next few years, we will see more and more services offering a simple point and click interface for streaming real-time data. This will allow companies to gain the value of streaming analytics while cutting the cost of the enabling infrastructure. The value of the data as companies will be able to analyze risks before they occur.\nAI and Analytics\n\n\n2020 - AI Will Put the Answers in the Hands of Business Users\nAs AI becomes more well-known and effective in operational analytics, we will begin to see companies, even data teams, combining different AI components at different times in the analytics lifecycle to come up with better suggestions and insights.\nIf you look at the AI trends today (graphs, Explainable AI, Continuous AI,) you can see that each one facilitates a specific aspect of analysis, or is used for a specific purpose. Graphs show relationships, Explainable AI helps with transparency behind the analytics, and Continuous AI helps in constantly discovering new insights and revealing a data story within a complete context. \nEach one, by itself, brings great insight to the organization. Combine them, and you will get a much more powerful solution.\nA typical example would be if a company is using AI to find outliers, then they can combine that insight with AI for key drivers. Now you will be able to find a cause for situations (key drivers) that vary from the norm (outliers) and make decisions about how to change them.\nIn a retail environment, a company that sells socks may discover a spike in sales (the outlier) from a previous month. The next step would be to analyze the key drivers to find out more details. This type of analysis uncovers details. For example, contributors might be the color red (i.e. product type dimension) or the region of Nebraska (geo-location dimension). Decision-makers can slice and dice these dimensions to find further insights like the demographics of the customers (age groups, etc.), and make decisions to boost sales in other territories with similar demographics. \n2030 - Analytic Apps Will Automate Consumption\nWe’ve been working on analytic apps since the beginning of last year, not because this is a buzzword, but because we believe that analytic apps will further automate the process of AI consumption, making it easier for data teams and business users to use different types of AI.\nBy 2030 though, quantum computing will be well-established :-). So for the sake of this trend, let’s say by 2025 every analytic app will be built on a sort of template, or “business question block”. This “block” is the perfect AI guide for the data expert or business user. \nWhy? In general, analysts and business users know their data. But they don’t know which type of analysis they need on the data. By choosing a template, they will inherit the analysis that needs to be done. \nA good example of this is an analytic app for marketing. If you want to show your marketing attribution, your analytics app with analysis components will automatically suggest which data sources you should connect to — Salesforce, Gainsight, Zendesk, or maybe all of them — in order to get the desired analytical results.\nNow the focus is on the questions, KPIs, and insights needed instead of the analytics functionality that needs to happen to get there. This will automate the use of AI in the organization and make it more friendly and effective for insights and analysis.\nKnowledge Graphs\n\n\n2020 - Knowledge Graphs will Drive More Database Technologies\nIt’s the perfect time to start using knowledge graphs for analytics. The technology is now standardized, and there is more data than ever before that can be manipulated and cast in a semantic graph format. However, there is more than one way to build a graph, and there are billions of ways to connect the data. Along with companies using knowledge graphs for BI, there will be a need to improve the ways to build the database powering the graphs.\nIn 2020, companies will begin to store their data in a format that is conducive to graphs and we will start to see more technologies that will help comprise the data in a data lake. These graph database technologies will improve the ways companies can build the database and improve the results that are seen in the knowledge graphs. \n\n\n2030 - Knowledge Graphs Will Start Using More AI Technologies\nOnce companies have become comfortable with the knowledge graph concept, they will begin to build their own algorithms so that they can maximize the value of their own semantic relationships in the graph.\nFrom here, we will see companies adding AI to get deeper insights.\nA recommendation system, another AI technology, can be based on the graph and be leveraged in applications like autocomplete to make personalized and timely suggestions. By using AI technologies, combining them, and putting them on top of the relationships found in the spider-like knowledge graphs, companies can discover deeper insights that are greater than anything we have today.\nFor instance, using an AI technology such as a recommendation service on a knowledge graph can help a dashboard designer with sharing suggestions. The dashboard designer will receive recommendations about dashboard visibility based on the relationships found in the knowledge graph from previous dashboards that were created and shared.\nChief Data Officers\n\n\n2020 - CDOs Will Begin Transitioning Into CEOs\nThe CDO is in a unique position at a company. Unlike other line-of-business executives, the CDO is charged with creating value from projects across multiple teams at an organization. Through the lens of companywide data collection and analysis, the CDOs are establishing a unique perspective at the executive table. When data-driven companies look at the line of succession to the CEO, a CDO’s cross-team optimizations will stand out since that work is already an important part of a CEO’s job description.\nIn the short term, this changes how data builders are measured in their daily work. As a data leader takes on more responsibilities, they will be viewed as having a transformative role with an effect felt across the entire organization. This is true for CDOs, but it’s also true for ambitious leaders anywhere at a company. Individual data builders will begin to feel more appreciated for analytical insights that impact their colleagues. Modern organizations are already building processes to collect and study data from every line of business, so it is a logical next step to start viewing those data experts as cross-team operations experts.\n2030 - 20 to 30% of CEOs Will Have a CDO Background\nToday, 0% of companies have a CEO who comes from a position of data leadership. Data at a large scale is so new that a lot of companies are still figuring out how to translate it into business value. The CDO position is still young too; so young that none of them have had the time to establish their expertise and ascend to the ranks of CEO. Ten years from now, early experiments will prove successful and more companies will recognize the value of a CEO who comes from a data leadership position.\nAs companies embrace the ubiquity of Big Data, it’s a natural step to see CDOs take on greater responsibility. Organizations that truly transform with data will value those data-based insights and will put stock in the people responsible for uncovering them. Organizations that are winning with data will begin to groom young data talent for more ambitious leadership roles in the decade ahead.\nSummary\nThis year is going to be the year when everything is going to come up data; data will drive processes and operations through analytics and BI, developers and data teams will emerge into the business and create what every business analyst and end-user have been waiting for — clear and efficient insights that will drive data-decision and lead to making from the top down for more successful businesses decisions.\nHere's to every company becoming a data company and our predictions for analytics and BI trends for 2020 and beyond.\nWatch a Demo\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/business-intelligence-and-data-analytics/sisense-data-and-analytics-trends/","title":"Sisense Data and Analytics Trends"},"https://mondelio.com/case-studies/":{"body":"","id":"https://mondelio.com/case-studies/","title":"Case Studies"},"https://mondelio.com/case-studies/digital-transformation-insurance-industry/":{"body":"Do You Trust Your Data?\nThe insurance industry will be investing $2.6b in digital transformation projects by 2021.\nThe reasons why the insurance industry lags behind in projects:\n\nIT budgets have not grown (avg. 3.8% in 2020 – most legacy maintenance)\nLacking vision re WHY need to change\nNot yet challenged by disruptor\nRoadmaps tactical and not strategic (process optimisation over business model transformation)\nCulture = inherent lack of appetite for risk\n\n\nDownload Case Study\n\n","id":"https://mondelio.com/case-studies/digital-transformation-insurance-industry/","title":"Digital Transformation - Insurance Industry"},"https://mondelio.com/case-studies/how-data-quality-impacts-on-manufacturing-4-0/":{"body":"HOW GOOD IS YOUR DATA?\nAt a time when major advances in machine learning , artificial intelligence and internet of things are being promoted in the industry, many manufacturers continue to struggle to incorporate advanced analytics into their business processes.
